Custom functions checking for NaNs and INFs that work even with flags ``-Ofast`` and ``-Offast-math``. Although I didn't check this, I suspect that the code should work on bigendian machines as well, because the byte layout of integers should be the same as the layout of floating-point numbers of the same length. Also see [a short note here](http://searchivarius.org/blog/gcc-disables-isnan-and-isinf-when-compiling-ffast-math-flag).
